Fork the repo, then clone it:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/django-amazon-price-monitor.git

Ensure the tests run:

    tox

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

    tox

Push to your fork and `submit a pull request`_.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
and we may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow the PEP8 style guide.
